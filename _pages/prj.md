[Research on Key Issues and Paths for Systemic Transformation in Sichuan Province under the Dual Carbon Goal](/pdf/TangJ-2022-Mechanism%20of%20Magnetic%20Flux%20Leakage%20Detection%20Method%20Based%20on%20the%20Slotted.pdf)
-	**Core Member**, **Supervisor:** `Xudong Chen`, Vice President of the College of Management Science
- **Key Contributions:** (1) Collected and organised data from 2018 to 2022, including population, economic, and eight types of energy consumption data in Sichuan Province. (2) Utilised the IPCC carbon emission calculation method to quantify carbon emissions in Sichuan Province from 2018 to 2022. (3) Developed a carbon emission driving factor decomposition model and applied the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to analyse the contribution and trends of various factors to carbon emissions. (4) Drafted Chapter Four of the project proposal, involving tasks such as table generation, data analysis, and technical roadmap creation.
- **Achievements:** Completed a project proposal and secured funding from the Sichuan Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Project funding: RMB200,000).

[Study of the Allocation Strategy of Water Pollutant Emission Permits in Tuojiang River Basin by Coordinating Water Resources, Water Environment and Water Ecological Management](/pdf/TangJ-2022-Mechanism%20of%20Magnetic%20Flux%20Leakage%20Detection%20Method%20Based%20on%20the%20Slotted.pdf)
-	**Core Member**, **Supervisor:** `Xue Feng`, Deputy Sector Chief of the College of Management Science
- **Key Contributions:** (1) Conducted literature review on three waters nexus, ecological compensation, and pollutant emission permits. (2) Collected and cleaned data for 17 years from six major cities in the Tuojiang River Basin. (3) Proposed integrating bidirectional ecological compensation mechanism with water pollutant emission permits allocation model. (4) Assisted in drafting the research results section and project report.
- **Achievements:** Published a paper (co-author) - Feng, X., Li, Y., Chen, X., Lv, Y., `Zhang, Z`., & Chen, S. (2023). Study of the allocation strategy of water pollutant emission permits under a bidirectional ecological compensation mechanism. Ecological Indicators, 154, 110849.

[Research of the Allocation Strategy of Water Pollutant Emission Permits Considering Ecological Compensation Mechanism Driven by Big Data - Taking Tuojiang River Basin as an Example](/pdf/TangJ-2022-Mechanism%20of%20Magnetic%20Flux%20Leakage%20Detection%20Method%20Based%20on%20the%20Slotted.pdf)
-	**Core Member**, **Supervisor:** `Xudong Chen`, Vice President of the College of Management Science
- **Key Contributions:** (1) Conducted literature review on big data analytics, ecological compensation, and pollutant emission permits, outlining the research framework and drawing a technical roadmap. (2) Assisted in developing a data-driven optimisation scheme for pollutant emission permits, designing a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm based on data analysis, and creating algorithm flowcharts. (3) Contributed to the writing of the research report, including the use of ArcGIS and Origin software for data analysis visualisation, table creation, and writing the conclusion section of the paper.
- **Achievements:** Published a paper (co-author) - Li, Y., Chen, X., Feng, X., Lv, Y., `Zhang, Z`., & Qi, Q. (2023). Investigation of the allocation and trading strategy of wastewater emission permits considering ecological compensation. Environmental Technology & Innovation, 30, 103103.
